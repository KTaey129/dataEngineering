Introduction
In this project, we leverage the Spotify Web API to extract metadata about music (tracks, artists, albums, etc.) and apply various data engineering best practices. The core objective is to showcase the end-to-end pipeline:

Extraction: Pulling data from the Spotify API using Python.

Transformation: Cleaning and transforming data into a structured format.

Loading: Storing data in a database or data lake for future analysis.

Key highlights:

Demonstrates a standard data engineering workflow.

Provides reproducible scripts to configure and authenticate with the Spotify API.

Uses Python for orchestrating the pipeline components.

Architecture Overview
Below is a conceptual diagram of the pipeline:

scripts/: Contains modular Python scripts to extract, transform, and load the Spotify data.

config/: Holds configuration files or environment variables for API credentials.

requirements.txt: Lists all the Python dependencies (Spotipy, Requests, etc.).

Setup & Installation
Clone the repository:



git clone https://github.com/KTaey129/dataEngineering.git
cd dataEngineering/spotifyAPI
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):



# On macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:



pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your Spotify Developer account:

Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

Create an app to obtain your Client ID and Client Secret.

Configuration
Environment Variables: Create a .env file or place your credentials in config/credentials.yaml (depending on your chosen approach), containing:



SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback/
Logging Configuration: Adjust log_config.ini or the logging settings (if any) to control log levels and log file locations.

Usage
Data Extraction:



python scripts/extract.py
This script connects to the Spotify API, authenticates using the provided credentials, and pulls data (tracks, artists, albums, etc.).

Data Transformation:



python scripts/transform.py
Cleans raw data, handles missing values, normalizes JSON responses, and transforms to a structured format (CSV, Parquet, etc.).

Data Loading:



python scripts/load.py
Loads the transformed data into your target destination (e.g., a local/remote database, data warehouse, or object storage like S3).

Data Exploration:

Check out the notebooks/ folder to see example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to query and analyze the ingested data.

Data Pipeline Flow
Extract: Pull data using the Spotify API (via extract.py).

Store Raw Data: Optionally store data in a staging area (like local JSON/CSV files or a staging DB).

Transform: Clean and convert the raw data into a standardized schema (via transform.py).

Load: Move final, cleaned data into the destination (via load.py).

Analyze: Use Jupyter notebooks or BI tools to explore and visualize insights.

Future Improvements
Automation: Integrate with workflow orchestration tools like Airflow or Luigi.

Containerization: Use Docker for packaging the pipeline and its dependencies.

CI/CD: Implement GitHub Actions to automate tests and deployments.

Scaling: Explore big data frameworks (Spark, Hadoop) for large-scale data processing.
