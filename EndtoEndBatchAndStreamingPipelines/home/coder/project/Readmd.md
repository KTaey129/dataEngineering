Introduction
In modern data engineering, organizations often handle batch workloads for large-scale transformations and streaming workloads for real-time or near real-time analytics. This project integrates both, demonstrating:

Batch Processing: Ideal for daily or hourly data pipelines, large-scale transformations, and data warehousing.

Streaming Ingestion: Processes real-time or near real-time data for low-latency insights.

It uses various AWS services (like Kinesis for streaming and possibly S3 or a data warehouse for batch) and Python-based scripts or notebooks to orchestrate the workflows.

Architecture Overview
The high-level architecture might look like this:


                 (Batch Flow)
     +---------+   +------------------+    +-----------------+
     | Source  |-->| Batch Ingestion  |--> | Data Warehouse  |
     | (CSV,DB)|   |  (ETL/ELT Jobs)  |    |  (e.g., Redshift|
     +---------+   +------------------+    +-----------------+
                                             ^              
                                             | (for analytics & BI)

                 (Streaming Flow)
     +---------+     +------------------------+      +-----------------+
     | Source  |---->| Stream Ingestion (KDS) |----->| Real-time Store |
     | (Logs, IoT)   | (e.g., Kinesis, Kafka) |      | (e.g., DynamoDB)|
     +---------+     +----------+-------------+      +-------+---------+
                                |                           |
                                | (Consumer)                |
                                v                           |
                        +------------------+                 |
                        | Real-time ETL    | (Lambda or Job) |
                        +------------------+                 |
                                                            |
                                                            +--> (Dashboards)
Batch Flow:

Sources: CSV files, databases, or any batch data source.

ETL jobs scheduled on a time-based cadence (daily, hourly, etc.).

Load into a data warehouse or data lake for large-scale analytics.

Streaming Flow:

Real-time data from logs, IoT devices, or event-based systems.

Ingestion via an event streaming platform like Amazon Kinesis.

Real-time consumers process data and write to a NoSQL store or other low-latency data store.

batch/: Scripts or notebooks handling scheduled (batch) ingestion, transformation, and loading.

streaming/: Producer and consumer scripts for real-time ingestion and processing.

config/: Configuration files (like credentials, environment variables, or YAML config).

logs/: Log files for debugging and monitoring.

Setup & Installation
Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/KTaey129/dataEngineering.git
cd dataEngineering/EndtoEndBatchAndStreamingPipelines/home/coder/project
Create & Activate a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):


# On macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
AWS Account (if used):

Configure AWS credentials (aws configure) if the pipeline interacts with AWS services (Kinesis, S3, Redshift, etc.).

Configuration
Credentials & Environment Variables:

Place AWS or other service credentials in config/credentials.yaml or a .env file (do not commit your secrets).

Example:


AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
AWS_REGION: "us-east-1"
Batch ETL Parameters:

Update batch_ingestion.py or the config with source file paths or database connection strings.

Update transformation logic or mapping.

Streaming Parameters:

Update stream details, such as Kinesis stream name or Kafka topic, in stream_producer.py and stream_consumer.py.

Usage
1. Batch Pipeline
Ingestion:


python batch/batch_ingestion.py
Reads data from a file system or external database and stores raw data in a staging area (e.g., local, S3).

Transformation:


python batch/batch_transformation.py
Cleans and transforms the staged data into a consumable format (e.g., CSV, Parquet).

Loading:

bash
복사
편집
python batch/batch_load.py
Loads final data into a data warehouse or other analytics store.

2. Streaming Pipeline
Run Producer:


python streaming/stream_producer.py
Simulates or reads real-time data sources (logs, IoT, events) and pushes messages to Kinesis (or Kafka).

Run Consumer:


python streaming/stream_consumer.py
Consumes messages in real-time, applies transformations, and writes to a real-time store (e.g., DynamoDB, Elasticsearch, etc.).

Data Pipeline Workflow
Batch:

Schedules daily or hourly jobs via a cron, Airflow, or another orchestrator.

Data is pulled from source systems, cleaned, and loaded into analytical databases.

Streaming:

Continually ingests data events in real-time.

Processes events (filtering, transformations) and stores them in a low-latency database or queue for further consumption.

This dual approach supports both historical analytics (batch) and immediate insights (streaming).

Monitoring & Logging
CloudWatch or Other Monitoring:

Use AWS CloudWatch if on AWS to monitor Kinesis streams, S3 bucket events, or Redshift usage.

Logs Directory:

Check logs/ for pipeline run logs, errors, and performance metrics.

Alerts:

Set up alerts for streaming pipeline lag, ETL job failures, or data quality thresholds.

Future Improvements
Containerization: Package scripts in Docker for easy deployment.

Orchestration: Leverage tools like Apache Airflow or AWS Step Functions for workflow automation.

CI/CD: Integrate with GitHub Actions or other CI/CD services for automated testing and deployment.

Scalability:

Use Spark or Flink for large-scale batch or streaming data, respectively.
